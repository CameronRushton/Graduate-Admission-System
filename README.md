## Project Development Information
The project is broken up into weekly sprints, each with their own Kanban board. These can be viewed on the repository's "Projects" tab, here: https://github.com/CameronRushton/Graduate-Admission-System/projects

## Project Status
The project is in its [second sprint](https://github.com/CameronRushton/Graduate-Admission-System/projects/2). The first sprint was not completed, so this will be completed first. After this, the second sprint focuses on making all controllers return only JSON, and using Aurelia for the front end. 3rd party authentication will be added in preparation for the next sprint, but will not filter responsibilites based on the role of a user.
