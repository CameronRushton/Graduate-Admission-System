# Graduate Admission System
This is a project to recreate a simple version of the Carleton graduate studies admission system, https://360.carleton.ca, for the course SYSC 4806.

[This link takes you to the production site](https://graduate-admission-system.herokuapp.com/), which will be stable but not always up to date

[This link takes you to the staging site](https://graduate-admission-staging.herokuapp.com/), which is more up to date, but may occasionally be down. This site will be merged into the production site every couple days.

Current staging status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CameronRushton/Graduate-Admission-System.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/CameronRushton/Graduate-Admission-System)

## Project Development Information
The project is broken up into weekly sprints, each with their own Kanban board. These can be viewed on the repository's "Projects" tab, here: https://github.com/CameronRushton/Graduate-Admission-System/projects

## Project Status
The project is in its [fourth sprint](https://github.com/CameronRushton/Graduate-Admission-System/projects/4). Rather than start new work, the focus for this week is completing all the work from previous sprints that have still not been completed. The project board created for this week contains all the issues that are not completed in previous sprints, so we can see how close we are to getting back on track.

## Login Details
