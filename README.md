## Project Development Information
The project is broken up into weekly sprints, each with their own Kanban board. These can be viewed on the repository's "Projects" tab, here: https://github.com/CameronRushton/Graduate-Admission-System/projects

## Project Status
The project is in its [first sprint](https://github.com/CameronRushton/Graduate-Admission-System/projects/1). The focus of this sprint is to set up the system model, along with a basic interface for each object that can perform CRUD operations. This will result in an application that performs like the AddressBook created in labs 1-5, but with our own model. This will serve as the base for the remainder of the project.

This diagram is based on the current UML class diagram, and will be replaced with IntelliJ's autogenerated diagram once the data base is set up.
