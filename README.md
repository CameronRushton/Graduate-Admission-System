## Project Development Information
The project is broken up into weekly sprints, each with their own Kanban board. These can be viewed on the repository's "Projects" tab, here: https://github.com/CameronRushton/Graduate-Admission-System/projects

## Project Status
The project is in its [third sprint](https://github.com/CameronRushton/Graduate-Admission-System/projects/3). This week is mainly focussed on catch up, since there are some tasks from sprints 1 and 2 that are not complete. User sessions and login will be added here, in preparation for giving students, profs, and admin different views in the next sprint once all work is caught up.
